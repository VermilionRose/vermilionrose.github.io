					<h3>Collegiate Start</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Didn't go to college for broadcasting. Started off in comp sci and then graduated with a degree in Digital Humanities from RIT, which looking back on, is pretty much what broadcasting and production, a neat little meeting point between humanity and its interaction with technology. <br> <br> While there, I poked my nose into esports, starting off as a League of Caster for Collegiate Star League but then quickly picked up on the backend of all shows, production, learning my way around OBS and then picking up vMix <br> <br> Never quite took any photos of myself or my work back then so here's my dog, Buddy, instead.</p>

					<h3>The Spring Break That Never Ended</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Graduated right into COVID-19 lockdown. However, that did not stop me from learning my absolutely favorite tool in broadcast to this day, a software switcher named vMix. This tool is my bread and butter, combining a powerful switcher paired with a built-in graphics designer perfect for the remote shows that an isolated world demanded. Great Lakes Gaming of Rochester gave me my start and I'll always remember them fondly, taking a shot at a new rookie in the field and from there, my career continued</p>

					<h3>Technical Director... And More</h3>
				</header>
				<p>vMix gave me a shot to really delve into show design with its powerful suite of tools. Building out shows using references, creating titles or graphics with custom animation ins and outs, referencing internal XML files to display the name of a playing song, adjusting and routing audio for remote talent, scripting in VB.NET to automate tasks and ease quality of life, and constructing dedicated and detailed Google Sheets Dashboard to facilitate show graphics all become staples in my ever expanding arsenal. <br><br> Events I've worked on include the Pittsburgh Knight's Gauntlets, the Annihilator Cup, the NACL Qualifiers, the NA Dota Championship League, NBA2K24 Launch, AT&T Roadshow, NIKE SNKRS Heating Up, Yu-Gi-Oh Worlds Champions 2024, the unofficial CBLOL English stream that got picked up by Riot Games, and even more traditional forms of broadcast like tabletop Dungeons & Dragons, satellite media tours for St. Patrick's Day, debates with the Free Press, and concerts like Essencefest</p>
